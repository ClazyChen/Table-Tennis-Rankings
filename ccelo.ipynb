    "- Use your cookies to visit the query API provided by ITTF. Use `format=json` if you do not want to analyze the raw HTML data.\n",
    "- You can first download all events, then all matches (using the event id), and finally players (using the player id in all matches).\n",
    "- You can run this jupyter notebook to convert the ITTF format to my format, or you may prefer your own format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My format\n",
    "I remove all redundant fields in the ITTF json. The data in my format is stored in two files: matches and players. For matches, I group them in end-dates, and rename the files with YYYYMMDD.json. In each json there is a list of dicts, and each dict represents a event which ended at the YYYYMMDD date. It is convenient for me to use these data to compute the ratings and rankings at a certain date then.\n",

    "Only single matches (MS or WS) is recorded in my format, as my algorithm is not suitable for double matches. Table tennis is significantly different from badminton that two strong players can always form a strong pair even if they have not play together in an ITTF/WTT double's match before. For example, SUN Yingsha and KUAI Man - I believe they can beat many players in double's matches - but this pair has no elo rating at all.\n",

    "## Step 4 - Run the ranking algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "I develop a dedicated algorithm for the ITTF/WTT rankings. It is based on the classic ELO algorithm, but I make some difference. Here I will make some explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table tennis has its uniqueness compared to some other typical sports with rating, e.g. tennis and chess. One of the main chellenges is that WTT events lack sufficient influence, thus some players do not regard WTT events as their most important professional activities. They can participate in high-level domestic professional events in China, Japan, and some other countries and regions. Some players even do not participate in any open events and can reach or maintain a considerably high competitive level just through in-team training. For example, FAN Siqi only participate in one WTT event (China Smash) in 2024, but in this event she defeat many high-level players, inclusing WANG Yidi, CHENG I-Ching, and MORI Sakura. Another challenge is that top table tennis players have extreme dominance. They may participate in a large number of events during their peak periods, with a winning rate exceeding 90%. This leads to a situation that their ratings may be quite high. When their competitive level declines due to aging or injury, the number of events they participate in will significantly decrease, resulting in insufficient rating deductions to reach an appropriate level. Of course, the current rating system of WTT can overcome the latter challenge with cleaning points after one year, and it would be better if WTT could enhance its influence and encourage high-level players to participate in more WTT events. Before that, please allow me to still establish a model based on the ELO method.\n",
    "\n",
    "My algorithm makes two modifications to the clasic ELO algorithm. Both of them are implemented with a sigmoid-like function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first point is \"long jump\".** In the classic algorithm, a player with a lower rating (e.g. HARIMOTO Tomokazu) defeating a player with a much higher rating (e.g. MA Long) will only increase a limited number of points. For a long time, everyone knew that the talented young player had extraordinary competitive level, but due to the sublinear rating growth his ranking would remain lower than the position recognized by the public. A even more obvious example comes from KIM Kum Yong, who defeated SUN Yingsha, WANG Yidi, and HARIMOTO Miwa at the Asian Championships, but still had a low ranking under the WTT rating system because she participated in no WTT events. To allow a talented player who is new to WTT events to quickly converge their rating to the appropriate level, I enable their points to increase rapidly, and the magnitude of this increase depends on the current rating of his/her oppponent. The \"long jump\" occasionally causes some players (e.g. TANAKA Yuta) to have inflated points. However, since situations like KIM Kum Yong occur more frequently, the benefits of \"long jump\" can outweigh the drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The second point is \"centripetal force\".** In simple terms, a player with a higher rating will find it more difficult to increase their points and easier to lose points, especially when losing to an opponent with a much lower rating than themselves. This is to address the issue of excessive inflation of points for top players, allowing their points to quickly \"fall to earth\" when their performance declines. On the other hand, the \"long jump\" results in a positive sum of point changes for the two players in a match, requiring a negative sum factor to make a balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has an accuracy rate of around **76%** in predicting the results of competitions after 2018/01/01, while WTT's current point rules have an accuracy rate of only about 66%.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pay attention:* High predictive accuracy is not the sole criterion to a ranking system. I have some algorithms that perform better in this metric, but employing them would result in drastic ranking fluctuations, rendering the rankings at a certain time point ineffective as a reliable reference. So, such algorithms cannot be deemed valid ranking algorithms."
